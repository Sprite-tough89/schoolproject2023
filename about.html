<div class='about-me'>
  <p>About 20 years ago I arrived at a local gym tired, weak and thirtsing for knowledge. There was a trainer at that gym thats showed me everything there ever was to know about getting bigger, stronger, faster and more explosvie. He taught me how to optimize my diet for best results possible.</p>
    
    <p>Every day was punishing. It stripped away everything I once was and built me into the machine that I am today.</p>
    
    <p>There is no easy way out, no magic pill. Theres will be no complaining. Every day there will be a new challange, another ache, another pain. I can help you rise above it and conquer your goals.</p>  
    
    <p>We will stop at nothing. You will have Strength Absolute.</p>
